# Galibot

## Requirements

You will need to have [docker](https://www.docker.io/gettingstarted/#h_installation) and [docker compose](http://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

## How to start?

```
cd kafka
docker-compose up
```

## Modules

## Kafka

All the messaging clients will subscribe/publish to kafka, so we can abstract all the logic from the different platforms and languages.

We initially will have two topics:

- Telegram
- Facebook

Node library for Kafka: https://www.npmjs.com/package/kafka-node
